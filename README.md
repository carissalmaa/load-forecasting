# Power Load & Energy Demand Forecasting 2025
**Case Study: JAMALI Grid (Jawa-Madura-Bali)**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting the electrical energy demand for the JAMALI (Jawa-Madura-Bali) power system for the year 2025. By analyzing historical data from 2022 to 2024, the system calculates monthly peak loads and total energy consumption using statistical and regression-based workflows.

## 🛠️ Technical Methodology
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and structuring historical load data to identify growth trends.
* **Peak Load Projection:** Calculating the 2025 peak load using a growth percentage based on historical trends.
* **Weighted Seasonal Index:** Applying seasonal coefficients to account for monthly variations in energy usage.
* **Load Factor Analysis:** Utilizing average monthly Load Factors to convert peak load (MW) into total monthly energy demand (GWh).

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Total Energy Estimation 2025:** Projections for the total TWh (Terawatt-hour) needed for the upcoming year.
* **Monthly Peak Distribution:** Identification of months with the highest power demand to aid in grid maintenance planning.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Libraries
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
  * `Pandas`: For data manipulation and time-series structuring.
  * `NumPy`: For numerical computations and array-based calculations.
  * `Matplotlib`: For generating projection charts and energy growth trends.
* **Framework:** Weighted Seasonal Index & Regression Workflow.

## 📈 Visualizations
The notebook generates several key visualizations:
1. Monthly Load Factor Trends.
2. Monthly Energy Demand Projections (GWh) for 2025.
3. Total 2025 Energy Summary Report.
